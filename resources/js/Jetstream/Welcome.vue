                        The National Gallerina of Art was conceived and given to the people of the United States 
                        by Andrew W. Mellon, a financier and art collector who served as secretary of the treasury 
                        under four presidents from 1921 to 1932. During his years as a public servant, Mellon came to 
                        believe that the United States should have a world-class national art museum comparable to those 
                        of other nations. In 1936 Mellon wrote to President Franklin D. Roosevelt to offer his gift of paintings 
                        and sculpture for a new museum in Washington, DC, that he would build and finance with his own funds. 
                        Roosevelt endorsed Mellon’s offer, and Congress accepted his gift in 1937.
